New Additions/Updates
+++++++++++++++++++++

DrugCentral
===========
The latest version of DrugCentral has been loaded and TDLs
re-calculated. There are 46 new Tclin targets as a result.

Phipster
========
Created new tables virus, viral_protein, viral_ppi and populated with
data received from Phipster group.

Rat Disease Ontology
====================
Added new tables rdo and rdo_xref and populated with Rat Disease
Ontology data. RDO.obo file has DOID:xxxxxxx ids and RGO ids as
alt_ids. TCRD uses doids in rdo and stores RGO ids as xrefs.

IMPC Phenotypes
===============
All IMPC phenotypes have been reloaded to include all
p-values. Previously, only phenotype associations with p-values < 0.05
were included. This change is due to the fact that the high p-value
associations are used as negatives when building knowledge graphs for
MetaPathML. Not sure if this has any repercussions for Pharos.

Fixes
+++++

DisGeNET
========
Disease associations from DisGeNET were reloaded to fix disease names.

Protein-Protein Interactions
============================
All data in ppi (Reactome, BioPlex and STRINGDB) table was reloaded
removing interactions involving the same protein.

DTO IDs and Classifications
===========================
Loaded DTO IDs into protein.dtoid.
Added a new column, dtoclass, to the protein table and populated with
DTO protein classifications.

DrugCentral Indication diseases
===============================
Rows in the disease table with dtype 'DrugCentral Indication' did not
have DOIDs in did column (where available). This has been fixed.

STRINGDB ppi scores
===================
Rows in the ppi table with ppitype 'STRINGDB' did not have scores. This
has been fixed.

Drug Target Ontology
====================
The dto table has been populated with the term hierarchy from the latest
version of DTO (corresponding to the IDs and classifications previously
in TCRD v6).

DTO
===
The format of the dto.parent_id column was updated to have semi-colons
instead of underscores (ie. DTO_##### -> DTO:#####)

Disease table
=============
The disease.pvalue column was changed from varchar to numeric. This
affects only disease rows from Expression Atlas.
